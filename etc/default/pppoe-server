#
# This is general configuration file for starting the PPPoE Sever
#

# Specify an ID for this server. If you want to force connection to a specific
# PPPoE server you must specific this ID to client. Even client doesn't have
# this specific ID, server will serve normal connections.
#
# Type: string
# Default: None
#
# Examples: PPPoE_ID="PPPoE"
#           PPPoE_ID="MyServer PPPoE0"
#           PPPoE_ID=""
#
#PPPoE_ID="MyNetwork"
PPPOE_ID=""

# Allows at most num concurrent PPPoE sessions.  If not specified, the default is 64.
# Because the PPPoE Server is started on each interface this mean this paramenter
# will limit the number of concurrent PPPoE sessions on that interface.
#
# Type: integer
# Default: 64
# Examples: PPPOE_SESSIONS=128
#
PPPOE_SESSIONS=256

# Maximum number of PPPoE servers running on this machine. This will limit the number of
# PPPoE daemons which will run on this machine. The script will generate a list of sessions
# and if you try to start more daemons, the script will not find any free sessions.
#
# Type: integer
# Default: 64
# Example: PPPOE_MAX=128
#
PPPOE_NUM=128

# Specify an alternate pppd configuration file. Default is /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options.
# This option causes pppoe-server to tell pppd to use the option file fname instead of the  default
# /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options.
#
# Type: string
# Default: /etc/ppp/pppoe-server-options
#
# Examples: PPPOE_config="/etc/ppp/mypppoe-server.conf"
#

# Sets  the  local  IP  address.   This is passed to spawned pppd processes.  If not specified, the
# default is 10.0.0.1.
#
# Type: IP
# Default: 10.0.0.1
#			    
# Examples: PPPOE_LOCALIP="192.168.0.1"
#
PPPOE_LOCALIP="10.245.244.1"

# Sets the starting remote IP address.  As sessions are established, IP addresses are assigned starting  from
# ip.    pppoe-server automatically keeps track of the pool of addresses and passes a valid remote IP address
# to pppd.  If not specified, a starting address of 10.67.15.1 is used.
#
# Useless if you use radius backand and set IP via radius.
#
# Type: IP
# Default: 10.67.15.1

# Examples: PPPOE_LOCALIP="192.168.100.1"
#
PPPOE_REMOTEIP="10.150.0.0"

# Specifies which name to report as the access concentrator name.  If not supplied, the host name is used.
# The name must be present in hosts for pppoe-server to get the IP and set it to NAS IP
#
# Type: string
# Default: None
#
#PPPOE_AC_NAME="My PPPoE"

# Use kernel mode. If you have kernel 2.4.0 or later and your kernel has pppoe and pppox module, say yes here
# Will reduce dramaticaly CPU usage on high traffic. You must compile the kernel with PPPoE support
# If is set to "auto" the script will check the help output of the pppoe-server command and tries to find out
# if the pppoe-server has the "-k" option. If it has will add it to the command line arguments when the 
# pppoe-server.service will starts.
